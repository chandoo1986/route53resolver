Running notes:

ACTION ITEMS:
- Create dedicated DNS VPC & associated resources (Subnets, NACL's , Security groups(DNS traffic (UDP port 53, and optionally TCP port 53) etc) (Cloud team).
- Create Resolver endpoints (Cloud team). 
  - Outbound endpoint. 
  - Inbound endpoint. 
- Create Forwarding rules (Cloud team). 
  - DNS queries from zone onprem.private to on prem 
  - DNS queries for zone awscloud.private to the IP addresses of the resolver inbound endpoint.
- Associate the rules with VPC (Cloud team). 
- Verify connectivity between on prem and DNS VPC (Cloud team).
- Accept Shared Forwarding Rules (Cloud team). This is not required if rules are shared with entire AWS organization. 
- Associate Forwarding Rules with VPCs in each participating acount (Cloud team/Devsecops team). 
- Create Private hosted zones in each participating account(Devsecops team).
- Associate the private hosted zone with DNS-VPC (Devsecops team). 


My notes:
- Dedicated VPC: 
Isolates dns infrastructure from other workloads. We can apply rules (security group, NACL) specific to the DNS-VPC without affecting workload VPCs.
- Solution also mentons that no VPC peering/connectivity is required between source/destination VPC and dns vpc. 
- DNS traffic and application traffic potentioally exposing DNS infrastructure.

- If centralized. account hosts workloads we need private hosted zone in centralized account. 
- Prepare cost estimation sheet.
